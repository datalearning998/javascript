// note need to check these in realtime and when testing some scenarios

let x = 10;  // Simple assignment operator, assigns 10 to x
/*
Customizing Assignment Operators:
You can customize assignment operators by combining them with arithmetic or bitwise operations:

+= (Addition Assignment): Adds and assigns in one step.
Example: x += 5; is the same as x = x + 5;

-= (Subtraction Assignment): Subtracts and assigns.
Example: x -= 3; is the same as x = x - 3;

*= (Multiplication Assignment): Multiplies and assigns.
Example: x *= 2; is the same as x = x * 2;

/= (Division Assignment): Divides and assigns.
Example: x /= 2; is the same as x = x / 2;
